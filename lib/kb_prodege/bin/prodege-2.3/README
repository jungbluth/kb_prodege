ProDeGe 2.3: a computational Protocol for fully-automated Decontamination of Genomes

PURPOSE
The purpose of this software is to decontaminate single amplified genomes and genomes assembled from metagenomes.

REQUIREMENTS
The user must have this software previously installed before running the install
script:
- Blast+ 2.2.28
- Perl 5.16.0 (with modules Bio::SeqIO and Bio::Perl)
- Prodigal 2.50
- R 3.0.1
The BLASTN_EXE envirnonmental variable is used to run blastn, R_EXE to run R,
and PRODIGAL_EXE to run prodigal. Else, please use 'module load' to set up your environment.

INPUT/OUTPUT
ProDeGe takes as input a fasta file that includes contigs from contaminant origin and the taxonomy of the 
target organism, and creates a fasta file including only the contigs from the target organism. Several 
intermediary files are created during the process.

INSTALL
To install the code unzip the tar and run the install script: 
tar xvzf prodege-X.X.tgz
Inside the prodege-X.X directory type:
sh prodege_install.sh
Required arguments: 
  -i <full path install location> 
For help:
  -h
The install script will download and install the blast databases. 

RUNNING
prodege.sh <configuration file>

CONFIGURATION
The program takes as input a configuration file. Below are the fields that should be in the file:
TAXON_DISPLAY_NAME=         # This field is not required, put quotes around if spaces
TAXON_DOMAIN=               # Put quotes around taxon var assignments
TAXON_PHYLUM=               # because some have spaces in them
TAXON_CLASS=                # like "Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group"
TAXON_ORDER=                # TAXON_X can be blank
TAXON_FAMILY=
TAXON_GENUS=            
INSTALL_LOCATION=           # Do not set this if you are using 'module load prodege'
WORKING_DIR=                # Prodege will create a folder $JOB_NAME in $WORKING_DIR
IN_FASTA=		    # Full path of input fna
JOB_NAME=                   # Clean fasta file will be: ${WORKING_DIR}/${JOB_NAME}/${JOB_NAME}_output_clean.fna
RUN_GENECALL=<0 to skip, 1 to run>
RUN_BLAST=<0 to skip, 1 to run>
RUN_CLASSIFY=<0 to skip, 1 to run>
RUN_ACCURACY=<0 to skip, 1 to run>  #contigs must have "clean" or "contam" in their fasta's contig name
BLAST_THREADS=                      #Default is 8 
KMER_CUTOFF=			    #Prodege is precalibrated with a cutoff, this field is optional
	
EXAMPLE
Two examples are included in the Examples folder.  The config.cfg needs to be updated with the install location and
the working directory.  To run the example type:
prodege.sh <config file>
